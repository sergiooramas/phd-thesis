abstract = {In modern societies, cultural change seems ceaseless. The flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music. While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of approximately{\{}{\~{}}{\}}17 000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic {\{}{\{}{\}}{\$}\backslash{\$}textquoteleft{\{}{\}}{\}}revolutions{\{}{\{}{\}}{\$}\backslash{\$}textquoteright{\{}{\}}{\}} around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative science of cultural change.},

Going{\$}\backslash{\$}nbeyond the analysis of linguistic features, such as n-grams, stylometric{\$}\backslash{\$}nvariables and word categories, this paper presents an exploratory study{\$}\backslash{\$}nof the role that emotions expressed in writing play to aid{\$}\backslash{\$}ndiscriminating author gender in different text genres. In this work, the{\$}\backslash{\$}ngender classification task is seen as a binary classification problem{\$}\backslash{\$}nwhere discriminating features are taken from a vectorial space that{\$}\backslash{\$}nincludes emotion-based features.

@article{Usbeck2015,
abstract = {The need to bridge between the unstructured data on the Document Web and the structured data on the Web of Data has led to the development of a considerable number of annotation tools. However, these tools are currently still hard to compare since the published evaluation results are calculated on diverse datasets and evaluated based on different measures. We present GERBIL, an evaluation framework for semantic entity annotation. The rationale behind our framework is to provide developers, end users and researchers with easy-to-use interfaces that allow for the agile, fine-grained and uniform evaluation of annotation tools on multiple datasets. By these means, we aim to ensure that both tool developers and end users can derive meaningful insights pertaining to the extension, integration and use of annotation applications. In particular, GERBIL provides comparable results to tool developers so as to allow them to easily discover the strengths and weaknesses of their implementations with respect to the state of the art. With the permanent experiment URIs provided by our framework, we ensure the reproducibility and archiving of evaluation results. Moreover, the framework generates data in machineprocessable format, allowing for the efficient querying and post-processing of evaluation results. Finally, the tool diagnostics provided by GERBIL allows deriving insights pertaining to the areas in which tools should be further refined, thus allowing developers to create an informed agenda for extensions and end users to detect the right tools for their purposes. GERBIL aims to become a focal point for the state of the art, driving the research agenda of the community by presenting comparable objective evaluation results.},

abstract = {The Music Recommender System Horst suggests musical entities, for instance bands or albums, which takes the users taste of music into account. The recommendation algorithm is based on semantic search technology and provides similar good results to traditional approaches such as collaborative or content-based filtering. A major benefit of the use of semantic technology is that results can be explained or justified by showing the connections between the interests of the users and the recommendations of the system by means of semantic networks. However, in a preliminary user survey we found out that justifications of this kind do not always satisfy the user's needs. In this paper, the effects of three factors of semantic networks are examined in a user experiment which influence user satisfaction: size of the network, edge label changes and diversity of edge directions. },

abstract = {This paper describes and evaluates a method for comput-ing artist similarity from a set of artist biographies. The proposed method aims at leveraging semantic information present in these biographies, and can be divided in three main steps, namely: (1) entity linking, i.e. detecting men-tions to named entities in the text and linking them to an external knowledge base; (2) deriving a knowledge rep-resentation from these mentions in the form of a seman-tic graph or a mapping to a vector-space model; and (3) computing semantic similarity between documents. We test this approach on a corpus of 188 artist biographies and a slightly larger dataset of 2,336 artists, both gathered from Last.fm. The former is mapped to the MIREX Audio and Music Similarity evaluation dataset, so that its similar-ity judgments can be used as ground truth. For the latter dataset we use the similarity between artists as provided by the Last.fm API. Our evaluation results show that an approach that computes similarity over a graph of entities and semantic categories clearly outperforms a baseline that exploits word co-occurrences and latent factors.},

abstract = {Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering. However, this approach suf- fers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantita- tively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We showthat using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep con- volutional neural networks significantly outperforming the traditional approach.},

We first develop a novel preference model by distinguishing different rating patterns of users, and then apply it to existing collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms. Our preference model, which is inspired by a voting method, is well-suited for representing qualitative user preferences. In particular, it can be easily implemented with less than 100 lines of codes on top of existing CF algorithms such as user-based, item-based, and matrix-factorization-based algorithms. When our preference model is combined to three kinds of CF algorithms, experimental results demonstrate that the preference model can improve the accuracy of all existing CF algorithms such as ATOP and NDCG@25 by 3-24{\%} and 6-98{\%}, respectively.},

CQT refers to a time-frequency represen- tation where the frequency bins are geometrically spaced and the Q-factors (ratios of the center frequencies to band- widths) of all bins are equal. An inverse transform is pro- posed which enables a reasonable-quality (around 55dB signal-to-noise ratio) reconstruction of the original signal from its CQT coefficients. Here CQTs with high Q-factors, equivalent to 12–96 bins per octave, are of particular inter- est. The proposed method is flexible with regard to the number of bins per octave, the applied window function, and the Q-factor, and is particularly suitable for the anal- ysis of music signals. A reference implementation of the proposed methods is published as a Matlab toolbox. The toolbox includes user-interface tools that facilitate spectral data visualization and the indexing and working with the data structure produced by the CQT.},

By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alterna- tive to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of “Canada” and “Air” cannot be easily combined to obtain “Air Canada”.

abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

In a ranked query a list of terms is specified, then the documents that most closely match the query are returned—in decreasing order of similarity—as answers. Crucial to the efficacy of ranked querying is the use of a similarity heuristic, a mechanism that assigns a numeric score indicating how closely a document and the query match. In this note we explore and categorise a range of similarity heuristics described in the literature. We have implemented all of these measures in a structured way, and have carried out retrieval experiments with a substantial subset of these measures. Our purpose with this work is threefold: first, in enumerating the various measures in an orthogonal framework we make it straightforward for other researchers to describe and discuss similarity measures; second, by experimenting with a wide range of the measures, we hope to observe which features yield good retrieval behaviour in a variety of retrieval environments; and third, by describing our results so far, to gather feedback on the issues we have uncovered. We demonstrate that it is surprisingly difficult to identify which techniques work best, and comment on the experimental methodology required to support any claims as to the superiority of one method over another.},

abstract = {In a variety of application domains the content to be recommended to users is associated with text. This includes research papers, movies with associated plot summaries, news articles, blog posts, etc. Recommendation approaches based on latent factor models can be extended naturally to leverage text by employing an explicit mapping from text to factors. This enables recommendations for new, unseen content, and may generalize better, since the factors for all items are produced by a compactly-parametrized model. Previous work has used topic models or averages of word embeddings for this mapping. In this paper we present a method leveraging deep recurrent neural networks to encode the text sequence into a latent vector, specifically gated recurrent units (GRUs) trained end-to-end on the collaborative filtering task. For the task of scientific paper recommendation, this yields models with significantly higher accuracy. In cold-start scenarios, we beat the previous state-of-the-art, all of which ignore word order. Performance is further improved by multi-task learning, where the text encoder network is trained for a combination of content recommendation and item metadata prediction. This regularizes the collaborative filtering model, ameliorating the problem of sparsity of the observed rating matrix.},

We test this approach on a corpus of 188 artist biographies and a slightly larger dataset of 2,336 artists, both gathered from Last.fm. The former is mapped to the MIREX Audio and Music Similarity evaluation dataset, so that its similar-ity judgments can be used as ground truth. For the latter dataset we use the similarity between artists as provided by the Last.fm API.

Our approach starts off by collecting thousands of stories about songs from the songfacts.com website. Then, we combine a state-of-the-art Entity Linking tool and a linguistically motivated rule-based algorithm to extract semantic relations between entity pairs. Next, relations with similar semantics are grouped into clusters by exploiting syntactic dependencies. These relations are ranked thanks to a novel confidence measure based on statistical and linguistic evidence. Evaluation is carried out intrinsically, by assessing each component of the pipeline, as well as in an extrinsic task, in which we evaluate the contribution of natural language explanations in music recommendation. We demonstrate that our method is able to discover novel facts with high precision, which are missing in current generic as well as music-specific knowledge repositories.},

abstract = {Word embeddings have been demonstrated to benefit NLP tasks impressively. Yet, there is room for improvement in the vector representations, because current word embeddings typically contain unnecessary information, i.e., noise. We propose two novel models to improve word embeddings by unsupervised learning, in order to yield word denoising embeddings. The word denoising embeddings are obtained by strengthening salient information and weakening noise in the original word embeddings, based on a deep feed-forward neural network filter. Results from benchmark tasks show that the filtered word denoising embeddings outperform the original word embeddings.},

This paper shows that the output of state-of-the-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the ReVerb Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TextRunner and woepos. More than 30{\%} of ReVerb's extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher---compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of ReVerb's errors, suggesting directions for future work.},

abstract = {Information extraction (IE) holds the promise of generating a large-scale knowledge base from the Webs natural language text. Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multiinstance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level.},

abstract = { Musical genres are categorical labels created by humans to characterize pieces of music. A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61{\%} for ten musical genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre classification.},

Some pairs of objects might be seen as being alternatives to each other (such as two pairs of jeans), while others may be seen as being complementary (such as a pair of jeans and a matching shirt). This information guides many of the choices that people make, from buying clothes to their interactions with each other. We seek here to model this human sense of the relationships between objects based on their appearance. Our approach is not based on fine-grained modeling of user annotations but rather on capturing the largest dataset possible and developing a scalable method for uncovering human notions of the visual relationships within. We cast this as a network inference problem defined on graphs of related images, and provide a large-scale dataset for the training and evaluation of the same. The system we develop is capable of recommending which clothes and accessories will go well together (and which will not), amongst a host of other applications.},

abstract = {In a modern recommender system, it is important to understand how products relate to each other. For example, while a user is looking for mobile phones, it might make sense to recommend other phones, but once they buy a phone, we might instead want to recommend batteries, cases, or chargers. These two types of recommendations are referred to as substitutes and complements: substitutes are products that can be purchased instead of each other, while complements are products that can be purchased in addition to each other. Here we develop a method to infer networks of substitutable and complementary products. We formulate this as a supervised link prediction task, where we learn the semantics of substitutes and complements from data associated with products. The primary source of data we use is the text of product reviews, though our method also makes use of features such as ratings, specifications, prices, and brands. Methodologically, we build topic models that are trained to automatically discover topics from text that are successful at predicting and explaining such relationships. Experimentally, we evaluate our system on the Amazon product catalog, a large dataset consisting of 9 million products, 237 million links, and 144 million reviews.},

Dominique Moïsi, an authority on international affairs, argues that our post-9/11 world has become divided by more than cultural fault lines. He chronicles how the geopolitics of today is characterized by a "clash of emotions," and how cultures of fear, humiliation, and hope are reshaping the world. Moïsi contends that the United States and Europe have been dominated by fears of the "other" and of their loss of a national identity and purpose. For Muslims, the combination of historical grievances, exclusion from the economic boon of globalization, and civil and religious conflicts have created a culture of humiliation that is quickly devolving into a culture of hatred. Meanwhile, Asia has been able to concentrate on building a better future and seizing the economic initiative from the American-dominated West, creating a new culture of hope. How will these varying emotions influence the political, social, and cultural conflicts that roil our world? And what will the effect of the world economic crisis be?--From publisher description.},

abstract = {Research indicates that people value music primarily because of the emotions it evokes. Yet, the notion of musical emotions remains controversial, and researchers have so far been unable to offer a satisfactory account of such emotions. We argue that the study of musical emotions has suffered from a neglect of underlying mechanisms. Specifically, researchers have studied musical emotions without regard to how they were evoked, or have assumed that the emotions must be based on the "default" mechanism for emotion induction, a cognitive appraisal. Here, we present a novel theoretical framework featuring six additional mechanisms through which music listening may induce emotions: (1) brain stem reflexes, (2) evaluative conditioning, (3) emotional contagion, (4) visual imagery, (5) episodic memory, and (6) musical expectancy. We propose that these mechanisms differ regarding such characteristics as their information focus, ontogenetic development, key brain regions, cultural impact, induction speed, degree of volitional influence, modularity, and dependence on musical structure. By synthesizing theory and findings from different domains, we are able to provide the first set of hypotheses that can help researchers to distinguish among the mechanisms. We show that failure to control for the underlying mechanism may lead to inconsistent or non-interpretable findings. Thus, we argue that the new framework may guide future research and help to resolve previous disagreements in the field. We conclude that music evokes emotions through mechanisms that are not unique to music, and that the study of musical emotions could benefit the emotion field as a whole by providing novel paradigms for emotion induction.},

@article{Heylighen2002,
abstract = {The context of a linguistic expression is defined as everything outside the expression itself that is necessary for unambiguous interpretation of the expression. As meaning can be conveyed either by the implicit, shared context or by the explicit form of the expression, the degree of context-dependence or ``contextuality'' of communication will vary, depending on the situation and preferences of the language producer. An empirical measure of this variation is proposed, the ``formality'' or ``F-score'', based on the frequencies of different word classes. Nouns, adjectives, articles and prepositions are more frequent in low-context or ``formal'' types of expression; pronouns, adverbs, verbs and interjections are more frequent in high-context styles. This measure adequately distinguishes different genres of language production using data for Dutch, French, Italian, and English. Factor analyses applied to data in 7 different languages produce a similar factor as the most important one. Both the data and the theoretical model suggest that contextuality decreases when unambiguous understanding becomes more important or more difficult to achieve, when the separation in space, time or background between the interlocutors increases, and when the speaker is male, introverted and/or academically educated.},

abstract = {Annotating music poses a cognitive load on listeners and this potentially interferes with the emotions being reported. One solution is to let software agents learn to make the annotator's task easier and more efficient. Emo is a music annotation prototype that combines inputs from both human and software agents to better study human listening. A compositional theory of musical meaning provides the overall heuristics for the annotation process, with the listener drawing upon different influences such as acoustics, lyrics and cultural metadata to focus on a specific musical mood. Software agents track the way these choices are made from the influences available. A functional theory of human emotion provides the basis for introducing necessary bias into the machine learning agents. Conflicting positive and negative emotions can be separated on the basis of their different function (reward-approach and threat-avoidance) or dysfunction (psychotic). Negative emotions have strong ambiguity and these are the focus of the experiment. The results of mining psychological features of lyrics are promising, recognisable in terms of common sense ideas of emotion and in terms of accuracy. Further ideas for deploying agents in this model of music annotation are presented.},

abstract = {Knowledge bases of entities and relations (either constructed manually or automatically) are behind many real world search engines, including those at Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Google. Those knowledge bases can be viewed as graphs with nodes representing entities and edges representing (primary) relationships, and various studies have been conducted on how to leverage them to answer entity seeking queries. Meanwhile, in a complementary direction, analyses over the query logs have enabled researchers to identify entity pairs that are statistically correlated. Such entity relationships are then presented to search users through the "related searches" feature in modern search engines. However, entity relationships thus discovered can often be "puzzling" to the users because why the entities are connected is often indescribable. In this paper, we propose a novel problem called entity relationship explanation, which seeks to explain why a pair of entities are connected, and solve this challenging problem by integrating the above two complementary approaches, i.e., we leverage the knowledge base to "explain" the connections discovered between entity pairs. More specifically, we present REX, a system that takes a pair of entities in a given knowledge base as input and efficiently identifies a ranked list of relationship explanations. We formally define relationship explanations and analyze their desirable properties. Furthermore, we design and implement algorithms to efficiently enumerate and rank all relationship explanations based on multiple measures of "interestingness." We perform extensive experiments over real web-scale data gathered from DBpedia and a commercial search engine, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of REX. We also perform user studies to corroborate the effectiveness of explanations generated by REX.},

@article{Brin1998,
abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine - the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of contexts on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of “authoritative ” information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of “hub pages ” that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristics for link-based analysis.},

Co-occurrences of artist names on web pages are analyzed to measure how often two artists are mentioned together on the same web page. We estimate conditional probabilities using the extracted page count. These conditional probabilities give a similarity measure which is evaluated using a data set containing 224 artists from 14 genres. For evaluation, we use two different methods, intra-/intergroup-similarities and k-Nearest Neighbors classification. Furthermore, a confidence filter and combinations of the results gained from three different query settings are tested. It is shown that these enhancements can raise the performance of our similarity measure. Comparing our results to those of similar approaches show that our approach, though being quite simple, performs well and can be used as a similarity measure that incorporates �social knowledge�.},

To classify artists we primarily use support vector machines. We present 3 experiments in which we address the fol- lowing issues. First, we study the performance of our ap- proach compared to previous work. Second, we investi- gate how daily fluctuations in the Internet affect our ap- proach. Third, on a set of 224 artists from 14 genres we study (a) howmany artists are necessary to define the con- cept of a genre, (b) which search engines performbest, (c) how to formulate search queries best, (d) which overall performance we can expect for classification, and finally (e) how our approach is suited as a similarity measure for artists.},

abstract = {This paper describes tools and methods developed as part of Linked Jazz, a project that uses Linked Open Data (LOD) to reveal personal and professional relationships among jazz musicians based on interviews from jazz archives. The overarching aim of Linked Jazz is to explore the possibilities offered by LOD to enhance the visibility of cultural heritage materials and enrich the semantics that describe them. While the full Linked Jazz dataset is still under development, this paper presents two applications that have laid the foundation for the creation of this dataset: the Mapping and Curator Tool, and the Transcript Analyzer. These applications have served primarily for data preparation, analysis, and curation and are representative of the types of tools and methods needed to craft linked data from digital content available on the web. This paper discusses these two domain-agnostic tools developed to create LOD from digital textual documents and offers insight into the process behind the creation of LOD in general.

abstract = {It would be interesting and valuable to devise an automatic measure of the similarity between twomusicians based only on an analysis of their recordings. To develop such a measure, however, presupposes some ‘ground truth' training data describing the actual similarity between certain pairs of artists that constitute the desired output of the measure. Since artist similarity is wholly subjective, such data is not easily obtained. In this paper, we describe several attempts to construct a full matrix of similarity measures between a set of some 400 popular artists by regularizing limited subjective judgment data. Wealsodetail our attempts to evaluate thesemeasures by comparison with direct subjective similarity judgments collected via a web- based survey in April 2002. Overall, we find that subjective artist similarities are quite variable between users—casting doubt on the concept of a single ‘ground truth'. Our best measure, however, gives reasonable agreement with the subjective data, and forms a useable stand-in. In addition, our evaluationmethodology may be useful for comparing other measures of artist similarity.},

In CF, entities are recommended to a new user based on the stated preferences of other, similar users. We describe a CF spider that collects from the Web lists of semantically related entities. These lists can then be used by existing CF algorithms by encoding them as 'pseudo-users'. Importantly, the spider can collect useful data without pre-programmed knowledge about the format of particular pages or particular sites. Instead, the CF spider uses commercial Web-search engines to find pages likely to contain lists in the domain of interest, and then applies previously proposed heuristics to extract lists from these pages. We show that data collected by this spider are nearly as effective for CF as data collected from real users, and more effective than data collected by two plausible hand-programmed spiders. In some cases, autonomously spidered data can also be combined with actual user data to improve performance.},

We also describe several extensions that bring competitive accuracy into neighborhood methods, which used to dominate the field. The chapter demonstrates how to utilize temporal models and implicit feedback to extend models accuracy.
