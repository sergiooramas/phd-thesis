\label{appendix:datasets}

\section{Datasets}
\label{appendix:datasets:datasets}

\noindent \textbf{ELMD} A novel dataset of \~13k documents and almost 150k annotated musical entities, which are in turn linked to DBpedia and MusicBrainz. From this corpus, a gold standard dataset of 200 documents with manually annotated entities is also created (Section~\ref{sec:linking:lastfm}). \url{http://mtg.upf.edu/download/datasets/elmd}

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent \textbf{MARD} A large dataset of about 64k albums with customer reviews, track acoustic features, metadata, and single-label genre annotations (Sections ~\ref{sec:musicology:mard} and \ref{sec:similarity:mard}).

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent \textbf{SAS} Two datasets of 188 and 2,336 artist biographies respectively, together with artist similarity ground truth data (Section ~\ref{sec:similarity:experimentalsetup}).

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent \textbf{KG-Rec} Two datasets of tags and text descriptions about musical items, together with user's feedback information on those items. A dataset of sounds with \~21k items and 20k users, and a dataset of songs with \~8.5k items and \~5k users (Section ~\ref{sec:graph-rec:datasets}).

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent \textbf{MSD-A} A dataset of \~24k artist biographies linked to the artists present in the Million Song Dataset (Section ~\ref{sec:cold-rec:dataset}).

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent \textbf{MuMu} A large dataset of about \~31k albums, with \~450k customer reviews, \~147k audio tracks, cover artworks, and multi-label genre annotations (Section ~\ref{sec:multi-class:mumu}).

\section{Knowledge Bases}

\noindent \textbf{KBSF} A Music Knowledge Base of popular music extracted from a corpus of \~32k documents with stories about songs (Section~\ref{sec:kb:exp:learnedkbs}).

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent \textbf{FlaBase} A Music Knowledge Base of flamenco music, created by combining data from 7 different data sources, and enriched with information extracted from \~1k artist biographies (Section~\ref{sec:musicology:flabase}).


\section{Software}

\noindent \textbf{ELVIS} A system that integrates different entity linking tools, providing high confident entity disambiguations.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent \textbf{Tartarus} A system to perform and evaluate deep learning experiments on classification and recommendation from different data modalities and their combination.
