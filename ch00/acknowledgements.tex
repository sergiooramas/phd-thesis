First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Xavier Serra, for giving me the opportunity to work in this fantastic environment, the Music Technology Group, and for his wise advises. Also, I want to give special thanks to Paco Gomez for teaching me how to be a researcher. This thesis does not have a specific co-supervisor, but along this journey I have met three great researchers and better persons who have helped me through my PhD and without whom this work would have not been possible, Mohamed Sordo, Vito Claudio Ostuni, and Oriol Nieto. 
Special thanks also to Frederic Font with whom I have shared through all these years office, research, music, and friendship.
A very important element of this thesis has been my collaboration with the TALN group. Everything started with pizza and water and now we have a lot papers together. It was great collaborating and partying with Luis Espinosa-Anke and Francesco Barbieri. Also special thanks to Horacio Saggion for his wise advises, and Tommaso Di Noia, Aonghus Lawlor and Michael O'Mahony for hosting me during my research stays at Politecnico de Bari and University College of Dublin and helping me in my research. 
A special mention to Ichiro Fujinaga and Susan Weiss, who strongly believed in my research line and partly supported my work. Also to my COFLA mates Emilia Gómez, Joaquin Mora, José Miguel Díaz-Báñez, and Justin Salomon, thanks for considering me a researcher from the first day. 
To my Pandora managers Andreas Ehmann, Oscar Celma, and Fabien Gouyon, who trusted me and gave me the opportunity to apply my research in the real world.

I also want to thank other amazing MTG people who shared with me knowledge and laughs throughout these years. In no specific order, thanks to the SIC-refugio team
Sebastian Mealla, Álvaro Sarasúa, Panos Papiotis. To Rafael Caro my musicologist mate. To Oriol Romaní and Juanjo Bosh for so much fun. To Alastair Porter and Dmitry Bogdanov. To Andrés Ferraro who shared my vision and helped me in the development of my ideas. To Jordi Pons for initiating me in the deep learning cult. To my roommates Eduardo Fonseca, Xavier Favory, and former roommates Dara, Hector, Giuseppe, and Albin. To even more great people I met in the MTG, Cárthach, Ángel, Dani, Marius, Perfe, Rong, and Georgi. To former members, Gopala and our conversations about semantics. Also to Sankalp, Sertan, Ajay and Martí. To Humberto. To my Pandora mates Massimo, Theo, Chun and Andreu. Sorry if I forgot to mention anyone.
Also thangs to Aurelio, Lydia, Sonia, Cristina, Magda and Alba for helping me with the administrative work.
Special thanks also to Fundació La Caixa and their scholarship program, to believe in me and support this research.

Last but not least, this work would have been never been possible without the support of my wife Chiara, who followed me to Barcelona and helped me to persue my dreams. Also to my lovely Olivia, I started my PhD and my paternity at the same time, and I am pretty sure these have been the happiest years of my life. Finally, many thanks to my parents and my brothers and sisters, who helped me so much along my whole life, I am here thanks to them.
